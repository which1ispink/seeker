# Seeker PHP Framework

Seeker is a minimal PHP framework that helps you quickly start writing object-oriented web applications from the ground up, leaving it up to you to create your own domain models.

## Installation

1- Clone this repository

2- Run the following command to install all dependencies
```bash
$ composer install
```

3- Fire it up with the PHP built-in server (or an Apache virtual host) and off you go!
```
$ php -S localhost:8080 -t public/
```

You can test everything is working correctly by going to http://localhost:8080 which should now display a welcome page.

## Server Requirements

Seeker is intended to be used with PHP 7.

It would probably still work with PHP 5.6 and newer versions but that's NOT recommended.
